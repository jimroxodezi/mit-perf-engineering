## Notes
### Work

The work of a program (on a given input) is the sum total of all the operations executed by the program.

Algorithm design can produde dramatic reductions in the amount od work it takes to solve a problem, as
when O(nlogn)-time start replaces a O(n^2)-time sort.

Reducing the work of a program does not automatically reduce its running time, however, due to the complex
nature of computer hardware.
